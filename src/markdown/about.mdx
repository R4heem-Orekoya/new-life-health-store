that are based in nature and backed by leading edge science. In addition to our range of
NeoLife Nutritionals, we offer scientifically formulated Nutriance Organic Skin Care and
earth-friendly Golden Home Care.

## Nutrition Startups

We also help people have success with startups. It’s kind of like a tech startup but with
nutrition. There’s low barriers to entry because we provide the infrastructure that any 
successful business needs, as well as a consumable product and compensation plan. So 
instead of having to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars to get started, it makes 
entrepreneurship accessible to everyone.

## End The Trend

We are committed to ending the Trend of Poor Wellness that is literally destroying families
 around the world.
 

It’s actually pretty scary when you look at the numbers.
The World Health Organization and CDC are estimating that by 2020, 3 out of every 4 deaths 
are going to be caused by either cancer, diabetes, or heart disease. And to me, the most 
heartbreaking part about that statistic is the fact that these are diseases of lifestyle. 
It’s not like we can catch them from someone. We can’t come home from work and say “Bob 
from accounting gave me heart disease”. No! A lot of times, the sad reality is that we 
do it to ourselves. Often times through the foods we eat and other unhealthy lifestyle factors.

Around the world, governments are starting to panic. They’re seeing the huge cost to society, 
and they are trying to find ways to stop it before it gets even more out of control. 
And they are admitting that they’re losing the battle. Which is kind of puzzling, 
because we know the problem and we also know the solution.
 

Leading health authorities are telling us. They’re saying that the key to optimal long-term health 
and preventing chronic disease, is just three simple things ‐ weight management, physical activity, 
and a diet rich in the whole food nutrients found in whole grains, fruits and vegetables, and 
omega-3 rich fish. So what’s gone wrong? Obviously we still have a problem because the state of 
our health is still declining. The problem is that it’s nearly impossible to get enough of those 
nutrients through diet alone. And that’s where we come in. We have a solution to bridge the gap 
that exists between diet and nutrition.

Our exclusive, superior quality nutrition products use nature’s finest whole food ingredients 
that are based in nature and backed by leading edge science.
In fact, each and every NeoLife product features the Scientific Advisory Board seal of approval, 
representing the worldwide network of leading doctors, researchers, nutrition experts, and state 
of the art research facilities all dedicated to delivering optimum health based on nature’s blueprint.
 

From core nutrition for a foundation of good health, to targeted solutions like heart health, 
immune strength, digestive health, children’s nutrition, and sport nutrition to name just a few, 
NeoLife’s got you covered. Our family of brands also includes the very first marine botanical-based 
organic skin care line in the Direct Selling Industry, Nutriance Organic and also earth-friendly 
Golden Home Care. Together we can be the solution. We can work to make a living, but live to make 
a difference. We can end the trend, using good nutrition as our weapon of choice. We can’t do it 
alone. Right now, we’re going through an expansion phase and are on a search to find people to 
partner with who share our passion for helping others get charged up on good nutrition. We believe 
that because people matter, health and wellness should matter. Join us on our mission to make the 
world a healthier and happier place.
